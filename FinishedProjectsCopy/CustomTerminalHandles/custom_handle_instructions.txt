This is a small project that randomly chooses your terminal handle
from one of the lines in the file HANDLES.txt included in this library.

instructions:
look for your .bashrc file by doing ls -a

put this line at the bottom of your bashrc file 

PS1="\e[0;36m$(~/Desktop/anims/pick_text.sh) (\w)\e[0m \n"

and change the directory above to wherever you downloaded this library to

pick_text.sh points to a file called HANDLES.txt, 
which currently contains Halo and CowboyBebop title cards

feel free to update for your own customisation
