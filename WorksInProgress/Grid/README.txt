grid.py
execute like this (not compatible with python2)
python3 grid.py

When executed grid.py does two things
1) it interactively generates a 2D plot (animates the plotting)
2) it saves a gif of this animated plotting

the main body shows the for loop structure necessary to animate and save as gif
image.io is a really neat utility!

the function that defines the movement can really be anything 
that you can put in a function, so this code can be ported easily and used
for other projects
