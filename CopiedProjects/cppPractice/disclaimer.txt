The adjacent directories were made over two years ago
following exercises from a book beginner book.

I can't say with certainty that any will run, and I'm
not sure they'll really be of much interest anyways.

TODO: follow up on those, and revisit the gitstarter
turn it into a readme incase you're brain stops working
and you have to learn git again from scratch
