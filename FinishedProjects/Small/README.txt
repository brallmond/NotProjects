These are small pieces of code that I made for fun or just to keep for later reference.

blinker.py
execute like this (not compatible with python3)
python blinker.py

Alternately prints two words in two different colors.

BOMB_word.py
execute like this (or use python3 instead of python)
python BOMB_word.py

Brute force script to count the character appearing in a position of a small library
of words. Solves a problem from the game Keep Talking and Nobody Explodes.

buffer.py
execute like this (not compatible with python3)
python buffer.py

This is unfinished, but the code to clear buffers in python is useful I guess.

comboCounter.py
execute like this (or use python3 instead of python)
python comboCounter.py

Prints combinations and number of combinations under different conditions.
This was made to brute force a simple statistical problem from Super Auto Pets,
and does not support user input (i.e. it's hardcoded and bad).

grid.py
execute like this (or use python3 instead of python)
python grid.py

Makes a square in terminal that slowly fills (increases in value) from 
the center to the edges.

light.sh
execute like this
. light.sh

Replaces terminal cursor with highlighted color that increases and decreases
in intensity while moving from right to left. Takes 2 optional arguments for speed and repetition.

listQuestion.py
execute like this (works with python as well)
python3 listQuestion.py 

some example code that I was going to post in a stack-overflow question
before I found the answer on stack-overflow

mixSentence.py
execute like this (not compatible with python3)
python mixSentence.py

This will prompt you for a phrase or sentence, and then it will randomly
return that sentence with the words in a different order.

pair.cc and pair.exe
execute like this
./pair.exe

Shows an implementation of std::vector and std::pair working together in cpp code.

perm_try.py
execute like this (or use python3 instead of python)
python perm_try.py

Shows an implementation of making permutations of strings. 

randSort.py
execute like this (or use python3 instead of python)
python randSort.py

Generates a list, shows the sorted list, and then "randomly" shakes the generated
list into a new ordering and compares to the sorted list. The intent was to do this
and count how many "shakes" it would take to be randomly in the right order, but this 
was not finished.

screen.py
execute like this (or use python3 instead of python)
python screen.py

Simply writes 1 to 4 from left to right in terminal.
