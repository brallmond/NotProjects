these are cpp files for small terminal animations. They've already been compiled
and their executables are stored in the test/ directory.

You can execute them like this
./GreenFileName

All the codes execute but they are very simple. 
It's neat to know how to use cpp for command line animations, but
it's not really a useful skill. Just fun.

The phrase printing executables have some emo lyrics in them from
when I made these originally, so that's fun.
