These are very short scripts, and here are their very short descriptions.

are_you_dumb.sh  
execute like this
. are_you_dumb.sh

It just prints out something that someone said to me once.

fizzbuzz.py  
execute like this (not compatible with python3)
python fizzbuzz.py

This is an interactive drinking game that uses fizzbuzz (simple coding problem).
If you enter the right response, you don't drink. If you get it wrong, you drink!
To exit, either exhaust all the numbers or press crtl+c on your keyboard.

mybrain.cc and mybrain.exe
execute like this
./mybrain.exe

This prints a bunch of sad faces. I thought the code was funny and the output
was even funnier. To exit, press crtl+c on your keyboard.
