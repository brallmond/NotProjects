This is plotting code I wrote that uses a very simplified data container 
or MC data for some general physics objects. The purpose of the code is 
to visualize in 3D the number of events passing different thresholds.
Hence, a 3D variable scan.

execute like this (also compatible with python3)
python3 variableScanImShow.py
